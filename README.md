# Online Examination Portal

**Online examination system with multiple-choice questions and automatic evaluation.**
UE24CS341A Software Engineering mini-project, PES University.

Faculty author multiple-choice questions into a tagged question bank, assemble them into an
examination and schedule it for a fixed window. Enrolled Students attempt it under a
server-enforced timer with autosave and resume. Every submission is evaluated automatically against
the stored answer key, and results are released when Faculty publishes them.

## Backlog

GitHub Project **Online Exam Portal - Backlog**: one issue per SRS requirement (`FR-001` … `FR-030`,
`NFR-001` … `NFR-014`) with story points, assignee, priority and sprint.

## Run locally

Python 3.10+ (CI uses 3.12). From the repository root, in PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
$env:DJANGO_SECRET_KEY = "dev-only"   # required: the app will not start without it (NFR-014)
$env:DJANGO_DEBUG = "1"
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser      # creates an Administrator
python manage.py runserver
```

Sign in at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/>. Django's admin site is at `/django-admin/`, because `/admin/` is reserved for the Administrator role's pages.
Run the tests with `python manage.py test`.

### Where code goes

| App | SAD component | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| `repository` | Exam Repository: **every model lives here** | — |
| `identity` | Identity & Enrollment Manager | FR-001 – FR-006, FR-015 |
| `questionbank` | Question Bank Manager | FR-007 – FR-009 |
| `examsetup` | Exam Setup Manager | FR-010 – FR-013 |
| `attempts` | Attempt Session Manager | FR-015 – FR-021, FR-029 |
| `evaluation` | Evaluation Engine | FR-022 – FR-024 |

**Every view must declare who may use it** (FR-003). Access is denied by default, so a view without a decorator returns 403 to everyone:

```python
from identity.access import roles, public
from repository.models import Role

@roles(Role.FACULTY)
def question_list(request): ...
```

Use `@public` only for sign-in, sign-out and registration.

## Workflow

Work happens on feature branches. The member who owns a backlog item raises the pull request that
closes it, another member reviews it, and only then is it merged into `main` (NFR-006).
